# Pebble Windows/macOS Porting Plan

Status: planning baseline after parallel repository exploration and adversarial review. This is the universal plan for porting Pebble from a macOS AppKit/Metal game to a Windows + macOS codebase while keeping the existing macOS app usable throughout.

## Source facts

- `Package.swift` currently declares `platforms: [.macOS(.v14)]` and has four targets: `PebbleCore`, `Pebble`, `pebsmoke`, and `pebserver`.
- `Sources/Pebble/` is the macOS client: AppKit shell, MTKView frame loop, Metal renderer, AVFoundation audio, ImageIO/CoreGraphics/Compression resource handling, and UI/screens.
- `Sources/PebbleCore/` is mostly headless gameplay/simulation, but it is not fully portable yet: `NetTransport.swift`/`NetSession.swift` use Apple Network, `Saves.swift` imports ambient SQLite3, `Settings.swift` hard-codes Application Support paths, and `MathX.swift` imports Apple simd.
- `pebsmoke` and `goldens/` are the main regression contract. Porting must keep deterministic goldens stable unless a separate gameplay change deliberately updates them.
- The existing macOS Metal app is the release fallback until the new Vulkan path reaches parity.

## External platform decisions

- Swift is officially supported for Windows development/deployment with Windows 10.0 minimum, and SwiftPM supports Windows as a platform: https://www.swift.org/platform-support/ and https://docs.swift.org/swiftpm/documentation/packagedescription/platform/.
- Vulkan on macOS means Vulkan portability through MoltenVK over Metal, not native Vulkan. The macOS Vulkan path must handle portability enumeration and `VK_KHR_portability_subset`: https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/portability_initiative.html and https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/blob/main/Docs/MoltenVK_Runtime_UserGuide.md.
- Use SDL or an equivalent platform shell for window/input/clipboard/DPI/Vulkan-surface work. SDL Vulkan loader behavior and MoltenVK lookup/bundling must be accounted for: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary.
- Prefer a small C/C++ portability layer with a C ABI for Vulkan/SDL/native audio/native sockets/native codecs where needed. Do not make unofficial Swift Vulkan bindings load-bearing.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Keep the macOS Metal app green until Vulkan is proven.
- Do not claim Windows support through empty targets, runtime-fatal stubs, broad skips, or blind Windows `swift build`.
- All CI/smoke runs must use an injected temp data root before constructing GameCore, SaveDB, settings, or social stores.
- No unreviewed `PEBBLE_REGOLD=1` in CI.
- Keep save and network formats stable unless a versioned migration/protocol bump is intentional.
- Keep simulation deterministic: no platform libm/trig drift in stateful logic, no hash-randomized ordering, no changed tick order, and no background mutation of live world state.
- Renderer ABI must be documented before Vulkan work: explicit bytes, strides, offsets, uniforms, texture formats, bindings, coordinate conventions, and visual baselines.

## Target architecture

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Portable deterministic core | Simulation, worldgen, registries, entities, systems, items, pure render data, protocol value types. No AppKit/Metal/AVFoundation/Network/SQLite/platform paths. |
| Runtime services | Clocks, executors, entropy, settings store, save store, network services, data roots, host callbacks. Injectable and fakeable. |
| macOS client | Existing AppKit + Metal path, preserved as default macOS release path. |
| Portable client | SDL/native shell + Vulkan backend through C ABI. Windows uses this path; macOS can optionally use Vulkan/MoltenVK. |
| Native portability layer | SDL/window/input/Vulkan/miniaudio/socket/codec glue behind stable C ABI. |
| Tools | pebsmoke, pebserver, packaging verifiers, and CI jobs. |

## Milestones

- **M0 Baseline freeze** — record current macOS builds, smoke output, screenshots, and golden status. No regoldening.
- **M1 Manifest and portable target split** — add truthful Windows-capable portable targets and CI without breaking the macOS app.
- **M2 Deterministic core purification** — remove platform services from deterministic/runtime code and run deterministic smoke on macOS/Windows.
- **M3 Persistence, network, and server portability** — injectable data roots, explicit SQLite, socket transport/direct-IP, portable pebserver.
- **M4 Platform services and codecs** — SDL shell, clipboard/dialogs, miniaudio sink, PNG/ZIP adapters, resource pack and skin portability.
- **M5 Renderer facade and Metal preservation** — backend-neutral frame/resource/capture/stats facade; Metal still default.
- **M6 Vulkan bootstrap** — Vulkan instance/device/swapchain via C ABI on Windows and macOS MoltenVK with portability handling.
- **M7 Vulkan world parity** — chunks, shadows, entities, particles, UI, ultra/bloom/composite, capture, screenshot baselines.
- **M8 Packaging beta** — verified macOS app zip and Windows portable zip with assets, licenses, native deps, and temp-root package smoke.

## First execution order

1. 01 → 13 minimal CI skeleton.
2. 02 + 03 deterministic target, math/time/executor seams.
3. 04 data-root/SQLite isolation so tests stop touching real user data.
4. 05 direct TCP transport and temp-root social storage.
5. 12 portable dedicated server, direct-IP smoke.
6. 06 render ABI freeze.
7. 08 Metal facade/preservation.
8. 09 SDL/window/input shell.
9. 11 codecs/resource packs/skins.
10. 10 audio sink.
11. 07 Vulkan backend.
12. 14 packaging.

## Global verification gates

- macOS: app target builds, Metal launch/render smoke works, full smoke stays green.
- Windows: explicit portable targets build; no Apple app/framework sources enter Windows target graph.
- Smoke: required suites run with nonzero check counts and injected temp data root.
- Persistence: settings/keybinds/social/saves/chunk blobs round-trip under a temp root.
- Network: protocol round-trips, malformed-frame behavior, localhost host/guest, direct-IP dedicated server.
- Renderer: ABI layout tests, Metal parity screenshots, Vulkan validation clean smoke, backend-specific screenshot baselines.
- Packaging: no repo resource dependency, correct assets/licenses/native dependency closure, temp-root launch smoke.
